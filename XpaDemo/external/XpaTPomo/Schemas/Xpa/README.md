# Schemas / Xpa
This folder does contain the Magic XPA Schema files which do ship with Magic XPA 3.3 and which do reside in AddOn\Schemas directory of 
a Magic installation. I copied them here for reference purposes. The schemas are used to validate Magic "sources" - which is simply XML 
files - against their xsd schema definition.  

## Demo program(s) using these schemas:  
- [OPOMO002_ShowXpaProject](/XpaDemo/Doc/Samples/XpaTPomo/OPOMO002_ShowXpaProject.md)
